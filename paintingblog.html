									<h2>Painting the Room</h2>
									<p>The story of my first (and last) time painting a room</p>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Last week, after my sister found out that she would be finishing her last semester of college online, 
									she decided that she wanted to redesign her room and asked me to help her. I assumed this meant 
									that she was going to clean her room and rearrange her furniture, so I unwittingly said yes, 
									thinking it would only take a maximum of 4-5  hours. But little did I know the mess I was getting 
									myself into. Apparently re-doing her room meant painting her entire room a different color. How was 
									I supposed to know that? She had gone 7 years of her life without complaining about the color of the 
									walls and suddenly the walls weren’t good enough for her. My parents tried very, very hard to 
									demotivate her by listing countless stories of their friends' poor experiences with painting. 
									Unfortunately for me, she’s extremely stubborn.
								</p>

								<p>The next morning, she headed off to Home Depot to buy the supplies she needed to paint her room. 
									The first order of business was taping up the edges of her room. This sounds like an easy job, 
									but trust me, it isn’t. We had to tape the bottom edges, ceiling, door frames, and outlets of her 
									room with absolute precision. This alone took 4-5 hours to complete and we hadn’t even started 
									painting yet. The next step was priming the room, which I didn’t even know we had to do. I thought 
									we would go straight from taping the room to painting it pink. So, technically we had to paint her 
									room twice, but who’s counting?
								</p>

								<p>We started off priming the room in good spirits because we finally were able to 
									use the paint rollers. After the first wall, we were halfway through our only bucket 
									of paint, which left the other half gallon for the rest of the three walls. This meant
									 we had to start rationing the paint. This turned out to be exceptionally difficult as 
									 we had to press the rollers extremely hard to squeeze out every drop of paint onto the
									  wall. This made the walls look patchy as we could see every brush stroke. We ended up 
									  with 4 very sore arms and 3 very ugly walls. At least we were done with the hard part 
									  though, right? Wrong! We checked online and found that if the primer was not put on 
									  well, the pink paint would look just as bad. So now after spending the night slaving 
									  away at these walls, we found out that we would have to do it all over again the next 
									  day. By this time my sister was regretting ever deciding to paint her walls in the first 
									  place, but we were int to deep to stop now. The next day we got two more cans of primer 
									  to make sure that we would not be in the position we were in the night before. Everything 
									  went pretty smoothly and we even got bubble tea at the end as a reward. I personally believe 
									  I deserved a bigger reward considering this wasn’t even my room I was painting.
								</p>

								<p>Once the primer had dried for 24 hours, it was time to put on the pink paint. I was equally 
									nervous to begin this and excited to get it over with. I was scared that the paint would not 
									look like a professional paint job, but I was also happy that this would be the last day I would 
									ever have to do this. We painted the walls carefully and smoothly making sure every spot was 
									covered evenly without streaking. And finally, after 5 days of tirelessly working on this room, 
									it was done. We stripped the tape off the walls and screwed the outlets back in to see the final, 
									finished result. Did the room look much better than before? Absolutely. Was it worth the effort? 
									Absolutely not.
								</p>

								<p>Looking back, I consider this to be a great learning experience for me. I now know that I will 
									never, ever paint another room for as long as I live. This is the kind of experience that doing 
									once is more than enough. I have also started to appreciate the color of my room more now that I 
									know how much effort it would take to change it.
